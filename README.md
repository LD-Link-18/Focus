* Adding programs is case-sensitive and requires ".exe" file extension at the end.
* Do not add "explorer.exe" to the program list.
* The program list is not saved so you have to enter the programs every time you restart the app.
* You can not delete a program from the list until you restart the app which will clear the entire list.
